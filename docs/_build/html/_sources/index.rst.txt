Statistical Essentials of Data Science
=========================================================

If we use a transportation metaphor we might say that statistics and
`machine learning <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning>`_
are the vehicles that take us to both new and familiar places.
We could also think of programming and `software engineering
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_engineering>`_ as the roads
and infrastructure necessary to make travel even possible.  Linear
algebra and basic statistics on the other hand aligns well with the 
motors and engines that propel our vehicles.

Statistics
-----------------------

The materials we cover dig into the basics, introducing the areas of
probability and statistics that are common to many data science
learning paths.  In addition to the content here, we provide a listing
of resources for further study that review and reinforce these topics.
Mastery of all this material is crucial for forming a strong
foundation for statistics, machine learning, data science, or any
other analytical and data-oriented discipline.

   probability-distributions
   paradigms
   statistics-concepts
   statistical-inference
   regression-classification-metrics      

We'll will be taking a tour of the fundamental concepts in probability
and *counting*, followed by core statistical concepts.  We will gain
some familiarity with statistical distributions and how they are used.
Finally we will conclude the with an introduction to hypothesis
testing and linear models.
